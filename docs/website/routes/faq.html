            <strong>
                There are a ton of localizations, can I only see mine?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            Yes, you can. Click on top right button ⋮ -> settings -> HTTP API and activate the option List only my
            localizations.
        </p>

            <strong>
                Why the screen of my Android device is always ON when I am sending samples or requesting to predict my
                localization?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            When the screen goes dark (by inactivity), the WI-FI card no longer scans the available networks. This was
            the behavior on my device, I also have tried to build the sink service as a background job, but without
            success. If you know a better way, let me know, or open an issue.
        </p>

            <strong>
                Do I need an Internet connection to see my localizations?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            No, the localization will be displayed from the application cache directory. If you clean it, you will need
            Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                Do I need an Internet connection when am I collecting samples?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            No, the application will store locally and automatically sync with server when you are back online.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                When I delete one localization, what data is deleted?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            The server will hard delete all data associated with the localization. There is no coming back;
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                You pretend to implement more indoor tracking algorithms, besides the Mean?
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            Yes, when the community starts to share information (currently is a cold start), I will provide more
            implementations.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                Can I suggest posts and/or algorithms?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            Yes, you can use the feedback form to propose new material.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>
                I have more than one device, can I share my localizations to another specific device?
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            Kind of, currently either you mark the localization as public or private for a list and/or predict, and is
            for all users. However, you can go to the settings -> general and click on Installation ID and set on all
            devices the same installation, and all will see the same localizations.
